Natwest Project Films

* Why are we doing this? 
To test our understanding and application of material covered. 

* How I expected the challenge to go. 
I expected to have less issues with frontend creation.

* What went well? 
I was able to complete the Backend creation & testing in a day. Postman used to test CRUD functionality of server instead of test script route.


* What didn't go as planned? 
The frontend creation has been a challenge. Not able to link up SQL to HTML and I struggled with the functions.


* Possible improvements for future revisions of the project. 
Better understanding of JIRA, SQL, functions and tying it into HTML.
